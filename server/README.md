##What to do - for backend engineers
1. add new endpoint /countries which should represent the data from the `countries` collection
1. add `countries` to /graphql endpoint
1. add `country` to `locations.graphql.schema` as a representative of `country` information
1. add functionality to use `limit` and `skip` as a parameters to fetch data through `/graphql` endpoint
1. If you run the following query, location will always be `null`. Please figure out why this is happening.
After you found out how this happens, please describe the reason and how you found the issue. 
```query RootQuery($owner: String) {  
      apartments(owner: $owner) {  
        items {  
          location {  
            title  
          }  
        }  
      }  
    }
```
